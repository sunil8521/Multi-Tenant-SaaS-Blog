1. Navigate to the ECS console and select the 'precious-gorilla-5xtzdq' cluster

2. Click on the 'my-fargate-task-service-azwjyeow' service

3. Select the 'Tasks' tab and find the task with ID '2c4619cb66074c66aff4a7a2f5a103a7'

4. Click on the task ID to view its details

5. In the task details page, scroll down to the 'Containers' section and select the 'server' container

6. Check the container logs for any error messages or stack traces that might explain the exit code 1

7. If the logs don't provide enough information, consider the following additional steps:
   - Review the container's environment variables for any misconfiguration
   - Check if the container has the necessary permissions to access other AWS resources it might need
   - Verify that the container's health check (if configured) is passing

8. If the issue persists, review the task definition:
   - Go back to the service page and click on the task definition name
   - Check the container definition for any potential issues with the command, entrypoint, or working directory

9. If you still can't identify the problem, consider updating the task definition to enable AWS CloudWatch logs:
   - Edit the task definition
   - In the 'Log configuration' section, select 'awslogs' as the log driver
   - Specify a CloudWatch log group name
   - Update the service to use the new task definition revision

10. After enabling CloudWatch logs, run the task again and check the logs in CloudWatch for more detailed information about the container's execution and the cause of the exit code 1

11. Based on the findings from the logs and configuration review, make necessary adjustments to the container configuration, application code, or task definition to resolve the issue causing the exit code 1

12. After making changes, update the service with the new task definition and monitor the new tasks to ensure they run successfully without exiting with code 1
